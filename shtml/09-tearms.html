		<h1><em>Tearms</em> of use</h1>
		<p class="lead">Our website grants you non-exclusive limited license to use the web
		template through our website (http://www.editorialtemplate.com) by Editorial (the
		“products”) in accordance with these Terms & Conditions (the “license”) issued by
		our company.</p>
		<h2>1. Theme Licensing & Usage</h2>
		<p>All our WordPress themes are licensed under the GNU general public license. Our
		themes may be used by our customers on as many websites as they like.</p>
		<h2>2. Themes Compatibility</h2>
		<p>It is our duty to always keep the themes up-to-date and working with the latest
		version of WordPress. Our themes are developed and fine-tuned for WordPress 3.0 or
		higher, any version prior to that may have problems with some theme functionality.</p>
		<h2>3. Browser Compatibility</h2>
		<p>Our themes support all modern web browsers including (but not limited to) Firefox,
		Safari, Chrome (all on PC & Mac) & Internet Explorer. Whilst we strive to give every
		a seamless & near-identical experience across each of these browsers, it is impossible
		to compensate for the lack of web standards support (relating to HTML & CSS) in some
		of these browsers. In the case of a browser not support certain web standards, we
		will include a generic workaround for that browser, which will degrade a specific
		function / feature gradually and in a way that doesn’t affect the user experience
		negatively.</p>
		<h2>4. Updates</h2>
		<p>Theme updates are available to customers who have made an individual theme purchase.
		They are also available for all the themes accessible by our club members whilst
		their club subscription is still active.</p>
		<h2>5. Delivery</h2>
		<p>After we have successfully received your payment, your Editorial Subscription or
		Individual Theme information will be emailed to the email address you provided.
		This may take up to 1 hour but usually happens within minutes. If you do not receive
		an email after this time period, contact us through our website. Upon logging in with
		the provided credentials, you will have instant access to all our themes and the
		support forum.</p>
		<p>Note: <em>No invoices will be available for your purchases / subscriptions, as the
		2Checkout.com sales receipt is deemed to be sufficient financial information.</em></p>
		<h2>6. Ownership</h2>
		<p>You may not claim intellectual or exclusive ownership to any of our products, 
		modified or unmodified. All products are property of Editorial. Our products are
		provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. In
		no event shall our juridical person be liable for any damages including, but not
		limited to, direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages or other
		losses arising out of the use of or inability to use our products.</p>
		<h2>7. Site Content</h2>
		<p>All content, including imagery, published on the EditorialTemplate.com domain,
		including site content published on the showcase, is property of Editorial and
		under copyright. Any replicated site content must be authorized and clearly 
		referenced back to the source. Content from the Editorial web site shall not be
		used or exploited for any commercial and non-private purposes without the prior
		written consent of Editorial.</p>
		<h2>8. Refund Policy</h2>
		<p>Since Editorial is offering non-tangible irrevocable, digital goods we do not
		issue refunds after the subscription or individual theme purchase is made, which 
		you are responsible for understanding upon registering at our site.</p>
		<h2>9. Support</h2>
		<p>Editorial offers these templates and designs ‘as is’, with no implied meaning 
		that they will function exactly as you wish or with all 3rd party components and 
		plugins. Further, we offer no support via email or otherwise for installation,
		customization, administration of WordPress itself. View our full support policy
		here.</p>
		<h2>10. Price Changes</h2>
		<p>Editorial reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or
		discontinue, temporarily or permanently, a subscription (or any part thereof) with
		or without notice. Prices of all subscriptions and products, including but not
		limited to monthly subscription plan fees, are subject to change upon 30 days
		notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes
		to the Editorial website.</p>
		<h2>11. Warranty</h2>
		<p>Editorial does not warranty or guarantee these templates in any manner. We
		cannot guarantee they will function with all 3rd party components, plugins or 
		web browsers. Browser compatibility should be tested against the demonstration
		templates on the demo server. Please ensure that the browsers you use will work
		with the templates as we can not guarantee that Editorial templates will work
		with all browser combinations.</p>
